## 📖 Overview

Java-based UI end-to-end automation framework for real Dulux UK customer journeys (buy a colour tester, launch the Visualizer app), tested with a Page Object Model + BDD architecture built on Playwright, Cucumber and Allure.

Also available as a [Python port](https://github.com/magdaU/playwright-python-dulux-uk) of this same project.

## 🧰 Tech Stack

| Tool | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Java | 25 | Language |
| Playwright | 1.50 | Browser automation (Chromium, Firefox, WebKit) |
| JUnit 5 | – | Test runner, launched via `cucumber-junit-platform-engine` |
| Cucumber | 7.18 | BDD layer — Gherkin feature files → JUnit test items |
| PicoContainer (`cucumber-picocontainer`) | – | Dependency injection, one context instance per scenario |
| AssertJ | – | Fluent assertions |
| Allure (`allure-cucumber7-jvm`) | 2.29 | Test reporting with Gherkin step rendering |
| Maven | – | Build tool |
| Docker / Docker Compose | – | Containerised, reproducible test runs |
| GitHub Actions | – | CI/CD pipeline, GitHub Pages |

## 🏛 Architecture

**Page Object Model + Component Objects**, with Gherkin scenarios (`src/test/resources/features`) bound to Playwright actions via Cucumber step definitions. A per-scenario `Context`, injected with PicoContainer, carries shared state between step classes.

## 🖼️ Visual Regression

Pixel-based visual regression testing detects unexpected UI changes in:

* colour finder;
* shade selection;
* shopping cart.

## ▶️ Run Tests

### Local

```bash
mvn test
```

### Smoke

```bash
mvn test -Dtest=CucumberRunner "-Dcucumber.filter.tags=@smoke"
```

### Docker

```bash
docker compose up --build
```
