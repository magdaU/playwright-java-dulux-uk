# Mirrors the GitHub Actions pipeline: Java 21, Chromium installed with its
# OS dependencies, Cucumber smoke suite run headless.

#   so the non-root runtime user can find it.
# - MAVEN_OPTS pins a local repository inside /app so dependencies resolved at
#   build time are reused at run time (no re-download on container start).
